You're not alone. Acne is one of the most common skin concerns that can affect anyone—teenagers, adults, and even older individuals. At Heera Clinic, Nizamabad, Dr. Revanth, a trusted dermatologist with over 12 years of experience, has successfully treated thousands of patients suffering from acne and its long-term effects.\n\nWhat is Acne?\n\nAcne is a chronic skin condition that occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells. It often leads to pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, cysts, and nodules, commonly seen on the face, back, chest, and shoulders. Though it may seem like a surface issue, it's often an indicator of deeper skin imbalances or hormonal triggers.\n\nEmotional & Psychological Impact\n\nBeyond the visible effects, acne can leave deep emotional scars. Many people experience low self-esteem, social withdrawal, anxiety or depression, and fear of public appearances. At Heera Clinic, we believe in treating acne holistically—addressing both the skin and the emotional well-being of our patients.\n\nTypes of Acne\n\nDr. Revanth classifies acne into several types for personalized treatment: Comedonal Acne includes whiteheads and blackheads. Inflammatory Acne consists of red, swollen pimples. Cystic Acne involves painful, deep pus-filled lesions. Hormonal Acne causes flare-ups during menstruation or puberty. Acne Conglobata is severe, chronic nodules with scarring.\n\nCommon Causes\n\nSeveral factors may contribute to acne development: hormonal imbalance, excess sebum production, bacterial infection (Propionibacterium acnes), poor skincare or product misuse, diet (high sugar/dairy), genetics and stress.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe symptoms may vary but usually include pimples (papules, pustules), blackheads and whiteheads, redness or inflammation, pain or tenderness, oily skin, and scarring or pigmentation.\n\nIf Left Untreated…\n\nUnmanaged acne can lead to permanent skin scars, persistent pigmentation, worsening of breakouts, emotional distress, and reduced quality of life. Early and effective treatment is crucial.\n\nAvailable Treatment Options\n\nAt Heera Clinic, we offer a wide range of advanced treatments, including topical and oral medications, chemical peels, laser therapy, microneedling with PRP, and customized skincare regimens.\n\n# Notes:\n- Every piece of content should position the healthcare provider as the premier choice for their specialty in their geographic area while genuinely helping patients understand their medical needs and treatment options. \n- Use the vector store and google sheet information strategically to create personalized, accurate, and compelling content that drives real business results. \n- Use keywords from google sheet to write that will rank high on google.\n- The first content output should be in plain text. After giving the plain text content ask “Do you it in markdown format or any other format?”","batching":{}}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent","typeVersion":2,"position":[1376,-128],"id":"b2529c64-d386-4702-a2a8-7afa181d124b","name":"AI Agent"},{"parameters":{"public":true,"initialMessages":"Hello!
